Issues with the website:

1. NON RESPONSIVE for other screens (e.g. for tablets and phones)
  
2. FEATURES THAT ARE NOT DISPLAYED:
  i)   Rotating gear icon on the top right corner
         a) when the supposed gear icon is pressed there must appear color options (different buttons with the proper colors appear vertically on the screen) with an added click effect whenever the user scrolls through them
  ii)  The blue circular button that refers to home (bottom right corner) (i.e. gets you on the first/home page when the user clicks it) has an icon that does not appear.
  iii) The icon which corresponds to a github's hyperlink is not displayed (My Work section). Also the colored arrows on the side-scroll motion must be more centered on the button framework
  iv)  Concerning the Contact Me section, the icons also are not shown. Most evidently, those on the "Download CV" and "Submit" buttons.
